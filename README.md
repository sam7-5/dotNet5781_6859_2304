college second year first semester project
written in c# based on three layer model with an xml database
(by the way we made a program that convert a list of object knowing his class property into xml file. link:"https://github.com/sam9875/c-list-to-xml-converter")
the software is a transportation system based in israel including bus lines from different areas and stations(with gps coordonates).

bonus:-- possibility to update time and distance between stations into a line 
      -- possibility to delete stations into a line 
      -- bus class in DO
      -- bus on trip class in DO
      -- user class in DO
      -- we have implemented buses partly (ui +xml)
